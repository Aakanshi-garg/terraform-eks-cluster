# Deploying EKS cluster with Terraform
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) project for deploying a secure and scalable Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster using Terraform. This setup provisions VPC networking,  EKS control plane, and worker nodes across multiple availability zones â€” fully automated and customizable.

## Project Overview

This project uses **Terraform** to automate the deployment of a highly available and scalable **Amazon EKS cluster** on AWS. It provisions the infrastructure needed to run Kubernetes workloads in a production-ready environment, including:

- Custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones
- EKS Control Plane setup 
- Managed Node Groups for compute capacity
- Secure and modular configuration using variables and modules

This setup is ideal for learning Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and building production-grade Kubernetes environments.

## Tools Used

- **Terraform** (v1.x)
- **AWS Provider** (v5.x)
- **Terraform AWS Modules**
  - `vpc`
  - `eks`
- **AWS CLI**

## Setting Up Infrastructure Directory in Terraform
Your structure should look like this:
```
terraform-eks-cluster/
â”œâ”€â”€ vpc.tf # VPC configuration using terraform-aws-modules/vpc
â”œâ”€â”€ eks.tf # EKS cluster, node groups, IAM roles
â”œâ”€â”€ provider.tf # AWS provider and region configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ terraform.tf # Required provider and Terraform version settings
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf # Input variables used throughout the setup
```

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-eks-cluster.git
cd terraform-eks-cluster
```

### 2. Configure AWS CLI 
```bash
aws configure
```
### 3. Initialize Terraform
 Initialize Terraform with the required providers and modules
```bash
terraform init 
```

### 4. Review the execution plan
Review the plan to apply changes
```bash
terraform plan
```

## ðŸ§¼ Cleanup
To destroy all infrastructure created:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
